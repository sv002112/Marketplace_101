#### Predicting Product Variant Blank and Average Ratings Using ML ###

# The Visibility Challenge #

When products have multiple variants (like size, color, or pack), we can only see the total star ratings and reviews for all variants combined—not for each variant individually.

For an individual variant, we only know:

Number of reviews per star (1–5 stars)	

Verified purchase counts per star

But we do not know for each variant:
Average Rating

Blank (unrated) count (number of purchases that did not leave a rating)

Total ratings + reviews (the true denominator for percentages)


# Our Data-Driven Solution (How It Works) #

We use marketplace data where all fields are visible (for combined variants) to train a machine learning model.

The model learns how review counts and verified purchases review count relate to average rating, blank count, and total ratings.

Now, when we have a new variant with only review and verified purchase counts, the model predicts:

Average Rating

Blank (unrated) count

Total ratings + reviews

Distribution of ratings (1–5 stars)

This gives you clear visibility on each variant—even when not all data is directly available.


# Model Training & Reliability #  

We train the model using your client product data—leveraging the exact review patterns and purchase behavior of your clients.

To make sure our predictions are realistic and not just theory, we reverse engineer:

We combine similar products (e.g., "Vacuum Cleaner V1" and "V1 Pro") into a single "test product" with two internal variants.

We hide the real variant breakdown from the model, only giving it the combined numbers (as in real-world usage).

After the model predicts the star breakdowns, blanks, and average rating for each variant, we compare these predictions to the actual data (ground truth) for each variant.


# Accuracy & Robustness #

We tested multiple machine learning models and selected the best, proven to handle missing, incomplete, or messy data.

Robustness: The chosen model performs well even when some stars or reviews are missing, thanks to its ensemble (many-decision-tree) nature.

Accuracy:

Validated against ground truth using business-relevant metrics:

MAE (Mean Absolute Error): “How far off are our predictions, on average?”

RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): “How big are the typical errors?”

R² (Explained Variance): “How much of the real-world variation do we capture?”

MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error): "How accurate are predictions in percent terms?"

Result: High explained variance and low error rates, demonstrating real reliability for your business.
